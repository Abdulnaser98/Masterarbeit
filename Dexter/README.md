## Dexter Data set

* This data set comprises similarity graphs for 21023 camera product specifications from 23 data sources. The original data set was used in the [Sigmod Programming Contest](http://www.inf.uniroma3.it/db/sigmod2020contest/index.html)
* Due to the dirtiness of the data sources, Alieh and Stefan generated different versions by reducing the number of duplicates. DS-C0 and DS-C100 mean that all entities are from dirty and clean sources, respectively.
* The similarity graphs were generated by using the manufacturer name, a list of model names, manufacturer part number (mpn), european article number (ean), digital and optical zoom, camera dimensions, weight, product code, sensor type, price and resolution for comparison. For blocking, they used a combined key of the manufacturer name and model number.
